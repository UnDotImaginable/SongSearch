# SongSearch

This was an in-class assignment. The BST (Binary Search Tree) class and the Tree interface were provided. We, the students, were tasked with creating the Song class and the main class. 

The purpose of this assignment is to write code that extracts Song information from a text file (namely the artist name, song title, the link to the song, and the song lyrics) and create a Song object with said information.

We are to, then, insert these objects into a BST of type Song. 

Once finished, we allow the user to search for a particular song using the title of the song.
